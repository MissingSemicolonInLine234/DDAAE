#DDAAE
Digital Data to Analogue Audio Encoder
##Version 0.2.0
This version still doesnt work ):
See my paper on the subject for more detail (basically just message me for the paper)
##How to install
This has an executable but otherwise I personally just compiled it with GNU.
I think it was just
```
g++ main.cpp -o prog.exe
```
and then
```
./prog.exe
```
for reference I'm running windows 10 and using powershell.
